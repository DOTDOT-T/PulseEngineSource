# PULSE ENGINE

PULSE ENGINE is a high-performance, custom game engine designed for flexibility, real-time rendering, and immersive gameplay experiences. Built from the ground up, it provides developers with the tools to craft unique games while maintaining full control over engine architecture and optimization.

## Why I Started PULSE ENGINE

I started building PULSE ENGINE out of pure passion for low-level programming and real-time systems.  
Existing engines felt either too closed, too heavy, or too abstracted away from the raw control I wanted.  

PULSE ENGINE is my way of exploring the deep mechanics of how a game engine truly works, from memory layout to rendering pipelines, and pushing performance as far as I can take it.  
It’s not just a tool; it’s an ongoing experiment in precision, modularity, and creative freedom.

## Features

- **Custom Game Engine Architecture**: Tailor-made for efficiency, modularity, and full control over the runtime.
- **Entity System**: Lightweight and extensible, optimized for real-time scene manipulation.
- **ImGui Integration**: Full editor/debug support with dynamic entity inspection and management.
- **High-Performance Rendering**: Engineered for low-level efficiency and real-time visual fidelity.
- **Extensible Framework**: Built to evolve — adapt and expand the engine to match your vision.
- **Cross-Platform Ready**: Core systems designed with portability and scalability in mind.
- **Synapse Editor**: A built-in node-based (blueprint-style) visual scripting environment for fast prototyping and logic creation.
- **Fully Modifiable Engine**: Every subsystem is accessible, allowing you to customize or replace any core component.
- **C++ Scripting API**: Clean and powerful API for integrating custom C++ scripts directly into the engine.
